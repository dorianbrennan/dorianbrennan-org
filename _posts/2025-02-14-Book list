Below are some of the books that I’ve read over the last few months.

I’ll start with We Solve Murders by Richard Osman. This was a fantastic murder investigation, and I hope it’s the first in a series. 

Next was Conclave by Robert Harris. This brings you into the election of a new pope. Such an interesting book and one that had me on the edge of my seat for most of the book.

Robert Thorogood released Murder on the Marlow Belle, the fourth book in the Marlow Murder Club series. What more can I say other than I love this series? It has everything you would want from an English murder mystery, and I look forward to the next.

Rivers of London by Ben Aaronovitch was an interesting read. It’s again a first in a series, and I may need to read another to really get into these books.

Words of Radiance by Brandon Sanderson. This is the second book in the series, and it’s a series that I’m going to have to read a number of times to fully understand it.
