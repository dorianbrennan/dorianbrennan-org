It has been some time since I’ve been excited for an app. One of the first posts I made on this site was about Clips and how I really enjoyed using it. Since then, not one app has made me excited to use it until Tapestry by The Iconfactory was released this past week to the public. 

Tapestry is a timeline app. You add feeds from all over the internet. These can include blogs, Bluesky and Mastodon accounts, YouTube channels, Tumblr, podcasts, and Reddit threads. These all get populated into a single ‘timeline’ that is organized oldest to newest. The app remembers your last position and gives a count of posts above that are still not seen. 

The app does a great job at showing different sources in different colors. So Bluesky posts will show up with a blue background, while blogs are purple, and YouTube is orange. Overall I really like the playful design and the bulging icons for each post. 

Whilst I really like the app, some people may not. While the app does show you posts, you have no way to interact with these posts. So no way to heart a Bluesky post or comment on a blog. So in no way is this going to replace all the apps, but if you’re like me and don’t comment or really interact with posts, then you might find yourself opening far fewer apps. 

Tapestry is free to use, or you can sign up for a subscription (or a one-time purchase) that allows removal of ads (so far the best ads I’ve seen on a site), custom timelines, muffle and mute content, icons and customizations.  Tapestry is available on iOS and iPadOS, funded via a Kickstarter. Hopefully, sometime in the future, they will bring a native Mac app.
