The Financial Times has just published a [Makers and Creators](https://www.ft.com/content/01ce4d84-d7bd-4bd0-b04a-bc009a4d37a5) guest list edited by designer Jony Ive. One of the pieces features a list of [twelve tools](https://www.ft.com/content/b73731f5-7563-4ff3-9c78-a226643b4648) Ive uses in his practice. I love articles like this because they offer a glimpse into how his mind works.

Item number ten on the list, the Mitutoyo 6-inch universal bevel protractor, is fantastic and an incredibly useful tool for designers.

In another [article](https://www.ft.com/content/fad9b72c-5386-4591-8667-1fb1596836dc), Ive speaks with renowned Australian designer Marc Newson. It is a great back and forth, and one line in particular really resonated with me:
>If you don’t know how to make something, and you go straight to defining form, it tends to be arbitrary.
