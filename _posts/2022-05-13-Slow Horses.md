I recently finished season one of [Slow Horses](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/slow-horses/umc.cmc.2szz3fdt71tl1ulnbp8utgq5o), the Apple TV+ original series based on the books by Mick Herron.

As a fan of the novels, it was great to see Slow Horses brought to life on screen. Gary Oldman as Jackson Lamb is inspired casting. I honestly cannot imagine anyone else playing him. Kristin Scott Thomas is equally well cast as Diana Taverner, and the performances across the board are excellent.

The show stays mostly true to the books, with a few differences, but overall I was very pleased with the production.

For anyone who has not read the novels but enjoys Jackson Lamb as a character, all I can say is that he gets better with age. Some will find his one-liners funny, others crude. I am firmly in the former camp.
