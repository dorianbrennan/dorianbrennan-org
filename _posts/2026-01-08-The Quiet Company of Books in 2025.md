As always, reading is a big part of who I am, and 2025 was no different. Below is a list of some of the books I read throughout the year. I almost reached my goal of 25 books (finishing 24), so hopefully this year I can meet and even surpass that number.

While I do not want to rank the books, as I enjoyed them all, a few stood out more than others in 2025. The first was Chasm City by Alastair Reynolds. This was my first time reading Reynolds, and I loved it. The world-building is fantastic, and I am really looking forward to reading more from the series this year.

The Detective by Matthew Reilly was also excellent and seems like it could be the start of a series.

I also found my way back to Stephen King this year and read several of his books. I particularly enjoy his novels featuring Holly Gibney, and I thought Never Flinch was fantastic.

I did have a few DNFs in 2025. One was The Killer Question by Janice Hallett. I have read several of her other books and knew what to expect, but for some reason this one just did not click for me. Another was Neuromancer by William Gibson, which I hope to revisit and finish sometime this year.

2026 is already off to a great start, and I am looking forward to reading the next installments in both the Judith Potts and the Hawthorne and Horowitz series. I have also discovered a few new to me authors that I am really excited to read.
