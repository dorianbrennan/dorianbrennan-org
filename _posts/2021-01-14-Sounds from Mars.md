NASA has released [audio recorded](https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/jpl/hear-audio-from-nasas-perseverance-as-it-travels-through-deep-space/) during the Perseverance mission to Mars. While en route to the Red Planet, the rover was equipped with two microphones designed to capture sound from both the spacecraft and the Martian surface.

The first recording features the rover’s fluid pump operating during its journey through space. Once Perseverance successfully landed on Mars on February 18, 2021, it began preparing to record the sounds of the planet itself.

>What does Mars actually sound like? Stay tuned: we may soon hear the sounds of another world. The Perseverance rover carries two microphones onboard and is set to land on the Red >Planet on Feb. 18, 2021. One mic has already sent back a test clip below, recorded en route. Come back for more after touchdown!

If you are curious to learn more, there is some fascinating [information available](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/mars-2020-perseverance/sounds-of-mars/) about how audio is captured and transmitted from the Perseverance rover while operating in deep space.
