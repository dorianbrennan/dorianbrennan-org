Letterform Archive has released a [wonderful video](https://letterformarchive.org/shop/unexpected-baskerville-the-story-of-lovefrom-serif/#video) on the creation of the LoveFrom Serif. The level of attention to detail and care that went into designing this typeface is remarkable.

It is a fantastic presentation by Antonio and Chris, with an introduction by Jony Ive.

>but very often we don't talk about why we do it. Jony Ive
