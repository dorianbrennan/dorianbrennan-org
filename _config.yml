  bio: >
    I am an architect, photographer, and writer with a deep interest in how 
    design shapes experience. On this site, I explore architecture and space, 
    technology, photography, and books that influence how we think about the 
    world. This is where ideas are tested, images are collected, and thoughts 
    are given room to unfold.
